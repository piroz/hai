## üêã local test

To run a Docker container locally, you can use the following commands

```bash
$ docker build -t hai-local .
$ docker run -p 9000:8080 hai-local
```

In a separate terminal, you can then locally invoke the function using cURL

```bash
$ curl -XPOST "http://localhost:9000/2015-03-31/functions/function/invocations" \
-d '{"payload":"hello world!", "requestContext":{"domainName":"hono"}, "headers":[], "httpMethod":"GET", "url": "/"}'
```
